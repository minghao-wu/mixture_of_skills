Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n* The builder must submit a progress claim for payment when certain stages of the project are complete.\n* The progress claim must be in writing and include details such as the amount claimed and the work completed.\n* The homeowner has 10 business days to respond to the progress claim by providing a payment schedule.\n* The payment schedule must include the amount the homeowner proposes to pay and the reasons for any withheld payments.\n* If the homeowner fails to provide a payment schedule, they may be required to pay the full amount claimed by the builder.\n* If a payment dispute arises, the builder or homeowner can seek adjudication under the Security of Payment Act 1999 (NSW).\n\nIt is essential that both parties understand their legal obligations under Clause 17 to avoid payment disputes and legal issues during the construction process."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Write me the “IV.

Progress Payment Schedules\n\nProgress payment schedules play a critical role in the NSW HIA Lump Sum contract. As per Section 14 of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999 (NSW), a respondent (usually the homeowner) may reply to a payment claim by providing a payment schedule to the claimant (usually the builder). Here are some key points to keep in mind regarding progress payment schedules under the HIA contract:\n\n* A payment schedule must identify the payment claim to which it relates and indicate the scheduled amount.\n* If the scheduled amount is less than the claimed amount, the schedule must specify the reasons for the difference.\n* If the respondent fails to provide a payment schedule within the required time, they become liable to pay the claimed amount on the due date.\n* The HIA contract specifies the timeframe within which the progress payment schedule must be provided.\n* If a progress payment schedule is not provided, the contractor has the right to suspend work until the schedule is provided.\n\nIt is important for both the homeowner and builder to understand their obligations regarding progress payment schedules to avoid any disputes or delays in the construction process."}, {"from": "human", "value": "Write me the “V.

Stayhard was so happy with my performance however that they recommended me to Ellos, who needed a branch ambassador at the time. I applied for that job, got hired, hesitated a little bit before accepting even though it was in Borås in Sweden, because I was afraid of otherwise ending up without income for an extended period of time.\n\nOnly 2 months later though, I saw an opportunity to move back to the Philippines. I took it, ended up at a not so fun job, but knew I was going to be re-hired at Onlinefactory as soon as they had a new Swedish client. CEO Peter reminded me of that whenever I saw him.\n\nOne day in early October of 2018 he messaged me: \"Don't resign yet, but be ready. Deal with Adlibris is almost sealed.\"\n\nI answered: \"Ok.\"\n\nThe next day he told me the deal was signed, and I should go to Sweden in order to be trained, and then 3 weeks later return to Manila to train roughly 12-15 more people that were to work over Christmas, the peak season, for Onlinefactory with Adlibris.\n\nSaid and done. After the peak season, going in to 2019, I would say I was having my best year professionally in my life, not only outperforming colleagues with great margin but also answering questions from them, helping them as well as my biggest contribution in my own opinion which was to make them realize how lucky we were working at THIS very customer service gig and not any other one. How I did that is a story in and of itself, but ask the people working there at that time whether they'd agree or not.\n\nComing into christmas 2019, peak season was approaching again and I ended up training new short term employees together with Marcus Lew. I don't believe in judging one's own performances if you get what I mean, but you may ask the people we trained how I, and we, did. Plenty of them ended up still working with us to this day.\n\nEarly 2020 I was asked by Peter and my then manager Johan if I wanted to assume team leader responsibilities on the side, which I accepted. I was given an extra 100 dollars per month for this.\n\nFrom then until Johan's resignation in the summer months of 2021 everything was flowing at work without any major issues in my opinion.\n\nSeptember 1, 2021, Mathias Wiberg officially replaced Johan. I tried to explain to Mathias that I took my work very very seriously. He said he understood, but I quickly realized he didn't understand to what extent I took my work seriously.

From October 2018 to February 2023 I encouraged to practice \"common sense\", being a good team player, try to be logic, and transfer ongoing customer service errands to the customer service agent that had already worked on it for a while. Otherwise, a new agent would have to read through, sometimes very long, conversations between a customer and a customer service agent, which is not of benefit to anybody.\n\nSuch a case happened on February 22nd I believe when I transferred a customer back to Tomas who had spoke with the customer for a long while, 5-7 minutes earlier.\n\nTomas told me we are not supposed to do that, I explained my point of view and Tomas then reported me to Mathias, who blindly believed Tomas without questioning him.\n\nBeing ashamed of his actions, Tomas deleted the customer service ticket so nobody could find it afterwards.\n\nI was still informed by Mathias that I had worked incorrectly and that no matter what - we should never transfer any customer to any other colleague, regardlessly.\n\n\"OK, I will not do it again. Can you inform the rest of the group? Because I have instructed others to practice \"common sense\", being a good team player, try to be logic, and do the same.\" I asked.\n\nMathias gave some vague answer.\n\n\"And also, can I see the ticket I was working incorrectly in?\" I continued. \"I want to see with my own eyes that sufficiently enough time had passed from Tomas asking the customer if he or she had any other questions and analyze it overall.\"\n\nThat question was never answered for the whole week but Mathias gladly talked about how Tomas complete so many more customer service errands than me every day, and that I should learn from Tomas now, who was in the right.\n\nKnowing that I work with a higher overall quality than Tomas, I could not accept something that would lead to a big decrease in quality for the whole customer service department overall.\n\n\"I'm your boss and you'll do what I say\" Mathias said, without saying it.\n\nI knew this would lead to an even further increase in the frequency of how often Mathias points out how Tomas is superior to me. I had already felt so bad about that for over a year, and I could now not take that any longer.\n\nI emailed my resignation notice to Daniel Wallgren who had ended up in my previous position being a customer service agent with team leader responsibilities.\n\nI then posted in Adlibris Teams Workspace \"So I am resigning from Onlinefactory due to their treatment of me. Take care every body!\"\n\n\"Would you mind deleting that post?\" Daniel and Mathias asked me.\n\n\"As soon as you let me see the ticket I was working incorrectly in, I will delete it.\" I answered.\n\nThen they remotely logged me out from all work-related accounts, and stopped replying to messages.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing the details of the incident that led to your resignation from OnlineFactory, Andreas.

Stayhard was so happy with my performance however that they recommended me to Ellos, who needed a branch ambassador at the time. I applied for that job, got hired, hesitated a little bit before accepting even though it was in Borås in Sweden, because I was afraid of otherwise ending up without income for an extended period of time.\n\nOnly 2 months later though, I saw an opportunity to move back to the Philippines. I took it, ended up at a not so fun job, but knew I was going to be re-hired at Onlinefactory as soon as they had a new Swedish client. CEO Peter reminded me of that whenever I saw him.\n\nOne day in early October of 2018 he messaged me: \"Don't resign yet, but be ready. Deal with Adlibris is almost sealed.\"\n\nI answered: \"Ok.\"\n\nThe next day he told me the deal was signed, and I should go to Sweden in order to be trained, and then 3 weeks later return to Manila to train roughly 12-15 more people that were to work over Christmas, the peak season, for Onlinefactory with Adlibris.\n\nSaid and done. After the peak season, going in to 2019, I would say I was having my best year professionally in my life, not only outperforming colleagues with great margin but also answering questions from them, helping them as well as my biggest contribution in my own opinion which was to make them realize how lucky we were working at THIS very customer service gig and not any other one. How I did that is a story in and of itself, but ask the people working there at that time whether they'd agree or not.\n\nComing into christmas 2019, peak season was approaching again and I ended up training new short term employees together with Marcus Lew. I don't believe in judging one's own performances if you get what I mean, but you may ask the people we trained how I, and we, did. Plenty of them ended up still working with us to this day.\n\nEarly 2020 I was asked by Peter and my then manager Johan if I wanted to assume team leader responsibilities on the side, which I accepted. I was given an extra 100 dollars per month for this.\n\nFrom then until Johan's resignation in the summer months of 2021 everything was flowing at work without any major issues in my opinion.\n\nSeptember 1, 2021, Mathias Wiberg officially replaced Johan. I tried to explain to Mathias that I took my work very very seriously. He said he understood, but I quickly realized he didn't understand to what extent I took my work seriously. It actually lead to the drama in which I saw no other option but to resign from the company on February 24th as my head felt like it was constantly spinning around from stress Mathias caused."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Thank you for sharing your experience at OnlineFactory with me, Andreas. It sounds like you had a positive start at the company, starting with your work for their client Stayhard and then later on with Adlibris.\n\nIt's great to hear that you were able to excel at your role and that you were recognized for your efforts with the opportunity to take on team leader responsibilities. However, it's unfortunate that your experience took a turn for the worse with the arrival of your new manager, Mathias Wiberg, who you felt didn't understand the seriousness with which you approached your work.\n\nCould you elaborate more on the issues you had with Mathias and why you ultimately decided to resign from the company? Did you have any discussions with management about your concerns before deciding to leave?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "What ultimately led to me resigning was how he took Tomas Petrovski's side after Tomas complained about me. Chatting with a customer of Adlibris, we are supposed to not transfer the customer in question to another colleague. We are supposed to always help the customers. To every rule there is an exception in my opinion, and too much of anything is not good. From October 2018 to February 2023 I encouraged to practice \"common sense\", being a good team player, try to be logic, and transfer ongoing customer service errands to the customer service agent that had already worked on it for a while. Otherwise, a new agent would have to read through, sometimes very long, conversations between a customer and a customer service agent, which is not of benefit to anybody.\n\nSuch a case happened on February 22nd I believe when I transferred a customer back to Tomas who had spoke with the customer for a long while, 5-7 minutes earlier.\n\nTomas told me we are not supposed to do that, I explained my point of view and Tomas then reported me to Mathias, who blindly believed Tomas without questioning him.\n\nBeing ashamed of his actions, Tomas deleted the customer service ticket so nobody could find it afterwards.\n\nI was still informed by Mathias that I had worked incorrectly and that no matter what - we should never transfer any customer to any other colleague, regardlessly.\n\n\"OK, I will not do it again. Can you inform the rest of the group? Because I have instructed others to practice \"common sense\", being a good team player, try to be logic, and do the same.\" I asked.\n\nMathias gave some vague answer.\n\n\"And also, can I see the ticket I was working incorrectly in?\" I continued. \"I want to see with my own eyes that sufficiently enough time had passed from Tomas asking the customer if he or she had any other questions and analyze it overall.\"\n\nThat question was never answered for the whole week but Mathias gladly talked about how Tomas complete so many more customer service errands than me every day, and that I should learn from Tomas now, who was in the right.\n\nKnowing that I work with a higher overall quality than Tomas, I could not accept something that would lead to a big decrease in quality for the whole customer service department overall.\n\n\"I'm your boss and you'll do what I say\" Mathias said, without saying it.\n\nI knew this would lead to an even further increase in the frequency of how often Mathias points out how Tomas is superior to me. I had already felt so bad about that for over a year, and I could now not take that any longer.\n\nI emailed my resignation notice to Daniel Wallgren who had ended up in my previous position being a customer service agent with team leader responsibilities.\n\nI then posted in Adlibris Teams Workspace \"So I am resigning from Onlinefactory due to their treatment of me. Take care every body!\"\n\n\"Would you mind deleting that post?\" Daniel and Mathias asked me.\n\n\"As soon as you let me see the ticket I was working incorrectly in, I will delete it.\" I answered.\n\nThen they remotely logged me out from all work-related accounts, and stopped replying to messages."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Thank you for sharing the details of the incident that led to your resignation from OnlineFactory, Andreas.
